## Reflection

This project was built primarily while I was studying in the Nucamp Full Stack Web and Mobile Application Development Bootcamp, during the React course. The project goals included using React, CSS, JavaScript, and Redux Toolkit in order to familiarize myself with these technologies. 

After the creation of the L.A. Bus Tours website, I decided to make something more dynamic. This application supports viewing a list of products which can be filtered on the basis of cup and personality type. It also supports sorting on the basis of price or name. There is a cart feature that allows quantity additions and deletions.

I ran into several challenges while implementing this project. One of the challenges was setting up Redux for the products sorting/filtering and the cart functionality. It was a unique challenge as it involved moving the brains of the operation, in comparison to the structure of simple JavaScript web applications, which I had already been accustomed to creating. Another issue I ran into that took some time to resolve involved incompatibilities of the transition package I was attempting to use with React Router Dom 6. After over a day of research I was able to settle on a working alternative, as the transition effect was not a component I wanted to leave out.

The technologies implemented in this project include React, React Router Dom 6, Redux with Toolkit, Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Framer Motion,  VanillaJS, JSX, CSS and more.
